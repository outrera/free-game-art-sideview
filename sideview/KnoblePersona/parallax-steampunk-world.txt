This is a MEGA pack that I made a long time ago, but recently updated. It took a lot of time and effort to make this one. I realy hope someone will use this in some awesome way. :)

As for use, anyone can use/alter/change anything they want with my images without needing to credit me, as long as you don't claim the art as your own. The same goes with all my other projects I submit. If you do choose you credit me, than just use my username (KnoblePersona.) Weather you just put that as a mention in your work or link to this pace, or my profile, is entirely up to you.

Here is everything needed to make a simple one level Android/iPhone style game. I've included 4 versions with common screen sizes (full sized, 1280x800, 960x540, 720x480).

Includes:
1) Background
    a) background layer
    b) foreground layer

2) Main Character Sprite Sheet
    a) Idle sequence
    b) Basic running sequence
    c) Attack running sequence
    d) Jump sequence
    e) Hit
    f) Death sequence

3) Baddie One Sprite Sheet
    a) Walk sequence
    b) Death sequence

4) Baddie Two Sprite Sheet
    a) Walk sequence
    b) Death sequence

5) Weapon 1: Small Gun

6) Weapon 2: Big Gun

7) Screen Assets
    a) 2 Action buttons
    b) Directional Compass
    c) Life meters
    d) Points Indicator
    e) Menu pull out

8) ReadMe files for the sprites included with all versions (dimensions) specifying each sprite size.

 

You can see a version of the game I started building using melonJS as the engine here: http://jeremygooch.com/sci-fiGameSample/ (move: arrow keys || jump: x). I envisioned having the character be able to move along the z-axis.

 

Anyways, feel free to take what I've started and build your own. Let me know if you have any questions regarding the files or if you need them in other formats/dimensions. All I ask is that you include my name and website (Jeremy Gooch http://jeremygooch.blogspot.com/) in any credits and/or accompanying documentation.

A Free collection of 13 different Old Assets from my Patreon Page.

All these assets art style match perfectly in a "Castlevania-like" theme game or project.  You will find spritesheets of animated horrors and heroes and some environments composed of seamless parallax backgrounds and complete tilesets at 16x16 pixels to build your levels.

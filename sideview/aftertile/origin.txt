These are the assets I made for Aftertile, my first Ludum Dare submission.

All the assets were done by me originally, except the dark green wall tiles and spikes, which were made using LittleSadNerd's gameboy tileset as a base.

I'm releasing these assets as public domain, so feel free to use them as you wish. They are legally yours!! <3

If let me know where you've used it, I'll be very happy! :D:D:D

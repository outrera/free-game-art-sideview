Hey guys !

Here's the assets i used for my previous projects, i know some of us don't want to spend time drawing some stuff just to test scripts or to build tiny games. So you're free to use or edit it but a credit will be apreciated.

First pack used here : https://dear-kira.itch.io/thief-road-to-assassin

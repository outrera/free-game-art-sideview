Back again! I have put together a little 2D platformer tileset that I felt mostly satisfied with!If you want to watch how I made most of this I have a couple of videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obSJ63a-0Bw

If you want to see other work I do, or keep up to date with my progects here is my Deviantart page: http://bizmasterstudios.deviantart.com/

If you use it, I would love to know about it! Hope this tileset helps out someone  :)

If you would like to see more added to this tileset, or some things fixed (like no stairs going down from left to right LOL) let me know your ideas!
Thanks for your time! Enjoy  :)

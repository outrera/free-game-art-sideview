Hey,
My name is Crateboy and this is a collection of things I made when I was 12 and another things I made when I wasn't 12. This collection of stuff (300+ files) is entirely creative commons, you can do what you want with it as long as it's good in spirit, you don't try to pass it off as your own or try to sell the individual components of this kit. There is so much stuff in here, some of it is good, some of it is crap, you'll probably find something useful if you look hard enough! When I was younger and made all this stuff the only thing I wanted more than a girlfriend was for people to enjoy what I made. Do young Crateboy a favor and sneak something of his into your game... after all, some of it is actually pretty cool... and maybe even useful. If you use something, mention my name!
If you want to support me from the present and future, consider donating or send me a motivational email or just play my games!
Enjoy :)

There's lots of stuff in there to enjoy and use. Lots of it has potential for cool projects other stuff were my first things I ever made, its really a mixed bag! I'm sure if you dig in there enough there's something for everyone whether its to use as is, remix, recolor, test, use as place holders or just generate ideas. Its all creative commons, you just have to use the stuff in good spirit, give credit where credit is due, don't pass it off as your own and don't sell it. You can use the stuff for commercial projects but consider donating or buy me a beer IDK. Have fun and let me know if you use anything!
Cheers,
Crateboy

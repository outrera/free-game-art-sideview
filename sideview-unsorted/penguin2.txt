This is a Penguin with a walking, standing, climbing, falling and digging animation. This spritesheet could be used in a Loderunner-style game.

If you feel like doing an open-source loderunner-like and want good ol' Tux to be part of it, use this spritesheet.

This spritesheet will be expanded in the future, if I'm not too lazy :)

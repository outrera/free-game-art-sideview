A set of tiles-sprites and a piece of "Tiled" map for a project that was cancelled.  i thought it's better to share here than possibly lost forever.

Maybe it has some purpose to someone in the end.

 

Inspired by Knight n' grail-Shovel Knight-Ghosts n' Goblins. 16 colors.

Map and tiles.png must be in the same folder.

Been struggling to find a good array of insects, invertebrates, or any other crawly creatures for Killer Ant Empire (play it when you can, thanks), so having to create the needed creatures.

They're not the best, and hopefully not the worst, but should come in useful to anyone that needs it. Only 4 frames for movement, nothing else on this.

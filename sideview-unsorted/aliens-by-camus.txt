NOTE: DONT USE THE CHARACTERS THEMSELVES, THEY ARE BASED ON DESIGNS FROM WARWIND GAME. BUT YOU CAN PROBABLY CUT OUT WEAPON AND THAT BUILDING BG.


They are not rip of the game, but real work start at zero.

It was character from a personnal abandonned project. so i share these sprites because they will not be used.
